#Sandwiches

This is a practice coded along with WWDC 2020 - Introduction to SwiftUI    

I've cloned the image resourses from [here](https://github.com/jaypricer/resources-intro-swiftui-wwdc20-10119).     

However, the navbar edit/add button seems different from the WWDC video at 47:05.   

Not intended to implement Arab localization.
